Vue.js and React.js are two popular frontend frameworks in the developer world

Both tools offer developers a productive approach to building various webApplication, but each has its own best use cases and responds to different business needs.

### why Vue.js VS React??

The main reason is time. Both frameworks can accomplish similar results, are popular in the community, and are used by successful businesses. But they **offer differences that impact the learning curve, implementation time, and ideal use cases.**

So, if you are a developer, you know that it takes a lot of effort to master technology. By smartly picking a few technologies to focus on, you won’t become a jack-of-all-trades(만물박사, 팔방미인) with hollow knowledge (공허한지식을가진 만물박사 (텅텅빈지식))

### Vue.js and React similarities

There are many reasons for Vue’s and React’s prominence in the developer landscape, but before we dive deeper into their distinctive features, let’s briefly go over what the two share that makes them so in demand:

- **Virtual DOM** —instead of re-rendering the whole page as is the case with regular DOM, React and Vue update **only those objects that have changed**, **saving time and resources that heavy DOM manipulations otherwise consume**.
- **Component-based UI development** — Vue’s and React’s considerable libraries of components facilitate code reuse, improve developer productivity, and speed up the development process.
- **Focus on the view library** — separate concerns for routing, state management, etc.
- **Usage of JavaScript** — both frameworks rely partially on JS which also means that developers that know this technology can easily learn both React and Vue.

# What Is Different Between React and Vue.js?

**Syntax**

One of the biggest differences between Vue and React is the way the view layer is built. By default, Vue uses HTML templates, but there’s an option to write in JSX.

In React, on the other hand, there’s solely JSX. Vue’s traditional separation of concerns into HTML, CSS, and JS makes it easier even for beginner frontend developers to learn how to create Web applications. HTML templates are also familiar to most Web designers, and thus improve collaboration between developers and designers.

React’s JavaScript Expressions (JSX) combine HTML and CSS together into JavaScript. This [XML-like syntax](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/comparison.html#HTML-amp-CSS) lets developers build self-contained UI components with view-rendering instructions included. We’ll talk about what that means later in the article.

# Usage among developers

Stars on Github is one thing but what is the actual regular usage of these frameworks? [The Jet Brains Dev Ecosystem 2021](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2021/javascript/) survey revealed that both the developer expertise and regular usage of the two frameworks are high, with Vue.js being on the rise. The share of Vue.js users grew from 34% in 2020 to 43% in 2021 while React experienced a drop from [64% to 49% in](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2020/javascript/) a YoY comparison.

Another statistic giving us a better overview of the Vue vs. React front is the yearly State of JS survey.

In 2022, there was a growing upward trend in the retention, interest, usage, and awareness ratio of Vue.js by developers which reached 77.4%, compared with 80% in 2021.

For React, the ratio in 2022 was at 83%, compared with 83.7% in 2021.

So if there is a business need for a more complex app, getting an experienced React developer who can jump into the project and start working immediately can take less time. On the other hand, the pool of Vue.js developers has been steadily growing in the last six years so this is becoming less challenging, too.

# Performance

Raw performance data can be easily found on [Stefan Krause’s website](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/index.html). The most up-to-date version was tested on a Razer Blade 15 Advanced (i7-8750H, 64 GB RAM, Fedora 36 (Linux 5.17.1, mitigations=off, Wayland), Chrome 100.0.4896.127 (64-bit)).It’s a comprehensive and detailed comparison of various JavaScript technologies.

However, to see how Vue and React match in the performance area, we also took a look at a more readable but less comprehensive comparison written by [Jacek Schae for Daily JS.](https://medium.com/dailyjs/a-realworld-comparison-of-front-end-frameworks-2020-4e50655fe4c1)

Jacek Schae used Google’s Lighthouse Audit to test how fast a RealWorld App implementation loads in a given technology. A score of 100 means that the tested website was lightning-fast.

# Scalability

**Vue** is purpose-built for creating interactive multi-page apps. You can quickly import its library and implement the framework to your existing apps. Also, the Vue CLI comes with ready-made scaffolding that allows you to start a new project in no time. When you install project dependencies, you implement them as plugins, so even if some standards change, you simply update the dependency.

As for the companion libraries for state management and routing, in Vue they are a part of the core library, so they are officially supported and up-to-date (unlike React, where they are community-based). It can be successfully used to build single-page apps, however, if you opt to use HTML syntax instead of JSX, reusing templates down the road can become cumbersome.

**React**, because of its impressive community, has a lot to offer. It’s lightweight enough to easily build multi-page apps but also good with single-page ones. **React is immensely useful for building scalable web apps (look at Facebook).** Unlike Vue, React doesn't provide ready-made solutions for e.g. routing, so you need to use third-party libraries for that (Flux/Redux, and create-react-app scaffolding tool).

React’s CLI comes out a bit poorer when compared to Vue’s. You cannot customize your project during generation but you can only use a single-page app template. From 2021 it is also possible to generate projects from user-built presets.

## **React vs Vue: An In-Depth Comparison**

To help you understand the difference between Reactjs vs Vuejs, the best approach is to compare them on certain parameters – which platform is easier to learn? Which has better performance? Which comes with decent scalability?

We will answer all of these questions below with unbiased details.

### **Performance in React vs Vue**

Performance is not a great concern in this comparison as Vue and React have a similar-sized architecture using virtual DOM. Vue currently takes about 80 kb, whereas React is around 100 kb. Hence, the Vue-based **[TezJS framework](https://tezjs.io/?utm_source=radix-blog&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=react-vs-vue)** leverages the same approach as VueJS and stands up to its expectations.

For example, as you can go through our discussion on **[Angular vs React vs Vue](https://radixweb.com/blog/angular-vs-react-vs-vue)**, the former tool wights almost 500 kb and lags in performance as it uses a regular DOM.

Nevertheless, Vue and React carry out the same manipulations within almost the same timeframe (just a few milliseconds of difference).

### **Market Position in React vs Vue**

It's totally normal for you to know whether other companies are using the same technology as you're planning to and how. And you cannot comprehend it in a better way than knowing what other websites and successful companies are using these frameworks.

Some of the organizations that decided to use Vue are Xiaomi, Nintendo, Grammarly, Facebook, Trivago, and GitLab. When it comes to React, the list includes Atlassian, Netflix, Dropbox, New York Times, Skype, Airbnb, etc.

### **Flexibility in React vs Vue**

React gives you the freedom to install any components of your choice, while Vue suggests particular components to create application features.

Hence, between React vs VueJS, experienced developers usually enjoy the flexibility of React, whereas newbie developers might have a preference for Vue's approachability. Although both have a component-based structure, **[using React.js for front-end development](https://radixweb.com/blog/react-js-for-frontend-development-features-benefits)** gets an edge over using Vue.

React also has a bigger community of developers than Vue, which results in an extensive list of components as well as solutions for development needs.

## **What Should You Choose Between Vue JS vs React?**

Vue or React or all other JavaScript frameworks are really cool if we take a look at their own use cases. If you want to pick a clear winner in this case, the best solution is to identify your use case and outline it within the nuances of these platforms.

### **Go for Vue if you:**

- Need to work on a smaller project that you want to learn and complete fast
- Plan to **[create progressive web apps](https://radixweb.com/services/progressive-web-apps-development)** and **[single-page apps](https://radixweb.com/blog/single-page-application-vs-multi-page-application)**.
- Want to scale up the functionalities of the current app

### **Go for React if you:**

- Want to facilitate your project with thousands of tools and libraries
- Have to build a large app with higher complexity and shorter time to market
- Need to create an app with beautiful components and high responsiveness
